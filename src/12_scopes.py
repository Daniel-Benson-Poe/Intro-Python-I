# Experiment with scopes in Python.

# When you use a variable in a function, it's local in scope to the function.
x = 12

def change_x():
    global x
    x = 99

change_x()

# This prints 12. What do we have to modify in change_x() to get it to print 99?
print(x) # In our function we used the "global" keyword to call in the global variable of x (with its value of 12). 
# now by changing the value of x in the function it changes the value of x globally as well.


# This nested function has a similar problem.

def outer():
    y = 120

    def inner():
        nonlocal y
        y = 999

    inner()

#     # This prints 120. What do we have to change in inner() to get it to print
#     # 999?
#     # Note: Google "python nested function scope".
# We call nonlocal variable for y which allows us to change the value in y from the outer() function
    print(y)
